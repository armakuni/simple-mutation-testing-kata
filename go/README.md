# Simple Mutation Testing Kata - Go

This is a golang implemention of the Simple Mutation Testing Kata.

This instruction for this kata will use [Go Gremlins](https://gremlins.dev/) but if you prefere to use 
[Go MuTesting](https://github.com/avito-tech/go-mutesting) there should be nothing stopping you.
